## Chest Xray Classification
* Using computer vision and machine learning concepts to build our own deep learning model to predict the difference between COVID19, Pneunomia and a normal/healthy Chest Xrays.
* Campared it to pretrained transfer learning models such as ResNet and VGG.
* Prepared a comparison chart based on the result and different metrics of scores and accuracy.
* Used random X ray images from Google Iamges to show our model works for any real world applications
